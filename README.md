After selecting a published paper and gather information about how they conducted their data analysis, I used the paper's raw data submitted in OSF to replicate their analyses designing my own code.
After replicating their findings with my own code, I designed an extension study using different participant variables collected in order to draw distinct inferences about the sample data. 
All results were presented and discussed in a final research report.
